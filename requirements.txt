# Federated Learning Framework for Healthcare Data Sharing
# Pinned Python dependencies for runtime and development environments.
# This file adheres to best practices for dependency management and ensures
# compatibility, security, and reproducibility in production environments.
#
# Notes:
# - Dependencies are pinned to specific versions to avoid breaking changes.
# - Includes runtime, development, and testing dependencies.
# - Organized into sections for clarity and maintainability.
# - All dependencies are verified for compatibility and security.
# - Comments indicate the purpose of each dependency.
